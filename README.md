# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Note for the project
> Do `npm start` to run start the react application. Do `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001` in seperate cmd to run json-server for backend.
> If there is any package dependency failure in case of npm start do npm install
> Once the App is running do login by clicking on the Login Button. Without Login You cant proceed further.Make sure your internet is working properly.
> For unit testing run npm test. Unit Testing has been done for one component header.js as per the required criteria.
> Please delete node_modules folder and package.json file from this in case an error occurs while compiling. After that do `npm start` which will automatically detect the packages used in this and install the same along with new package.json.
> Do use Flow Language Support extension incase this file doesn't work. While Flow language support extension is active please disable the TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features extension.
